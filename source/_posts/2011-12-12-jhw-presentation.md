title: Jasmine Headless WebKit Presentation

If you're looking for the current iteration of my [Jasmine Headless WebKit](http://johnbintz.github.com/jasmine-headless-webkit/) presentation, which
covers more nuts and bolts of JHW rather than Jasmine itself, it's here: [http://johnbintz.github.com/jasmine-headless-webkit-presentation](http://johnbintz.github.com/jasmine-headless-webkit-presentation)

Even if JS testing isn't your thing, I do have a few cool things going on in here:

* I'm using a custom Guard that uses Sprockets to regenerate the presentation's CSS and JS
* I have Solarized Light colors on whatever I can style
* I plugged Rack::LiveReload in front of ShowOff so the browser reloads as I work on the slides
