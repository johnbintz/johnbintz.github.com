title: Autogenerate Cucumber steps, John-style
layout: post
---
Following up on an [experiment I started earlier this year](/blog/2012/01/03/cucumber-step-definitions-in-separate-files/),
I created a Cucumber formatter that will write out undefined steps to a directory you specify. So much less copypaste for
my workflow.

Stay tuned to the gist for updates. I may even roll a similar functionality into [Flowerbox](http://johnbintz.github.com/flowerbox/).
