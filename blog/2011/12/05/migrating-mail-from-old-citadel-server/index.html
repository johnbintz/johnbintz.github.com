<p>I have an old Citadel server that I want to move mail from, the destination being a new Citadel server. The old server is older than the new
over-the-wire or XML support, so I&#8217;m doing it the hard way and copying messages from one to another over the network. I found
<a href="http://www.athensfbc.com/imap_tools/">imapcopy.pl</a> which is getting the job done nicely. Everything else will have to come over manually,
which will actualy be faster thatn trying to upgrade anything. :/</p>
